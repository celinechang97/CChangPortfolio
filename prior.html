         <br>
         My teammates and I created a web application to help college students organize and prioritize their tasks in daily, weekly, and monthly views. This is different from a normal calendar in that  it is targeted to help people get things done. This platform guides users by breaking down their progress - it shows when they plan on completing the task, how long it will take them to complete it, the importance of the task, and they can also mark it as done when they have accomplished it. As seen below, each card holds all the necessary information mentioned above, with colors representing the importance to help users visualize priority – the darker the shade of red, the higher the priority of the task.

               Students’ biggest pain of their current modes of organization was 
               <div class="io_emphasis"> <strong> difficult accessibility and usage. </strong></div>
               They spent too much time organizing the tasks than actually executing them as it didn't actually help them prioritize all the tasks. Moreover, many people used multiple methods of organization to keep track of all the different tasks in their lives, which was inefficient as they had to navigate back and forth between their applications.

              Throughout the ten week process of this project, we conducted user-testing with at least three people every week. We started out with a paper prototype to ensure that all of the necessary tasks were clear. Some of the takeaways from this stage was that our original way of indicating the importance of the task was confusing and that people found the tasks too spread out. We then mocked up a rough version on the computer to ensure that the flow of the application was intuitive. From the testings, we found that people didn't want to manually type in how many minutes it was going to take them to complete the task, that the filter buttons were confusing without a label, and that people wanted more choices other than "social, work, and class." 
              <!--Before implementing the application on a digital platform, we started with paper prototyping and user-testing with the mock-up to ensure that we hit all of the pains and needs we found through our interviews and observations. We constantly conducted user-testing throughout our process even as we moved onto the digital platform and implemented those valuable feedback in our final design.-->
               <!-- To address our users’ biggest pain point, we made sure to make this application accessible by making it into a web application that can be easily accessed from computers-- something students always carry around. We also ensured that the process of navigating and utilizing this app was as easy as possible by keeping everything minimal. Lastly, we created three different views (daily, weekly, monthly) to avoid using multiple modes of organization.-->

       <!-- from the initial insights and the findings from user-testing, we implemented the following features: 

        *1. We implemented three views - daily, weekly, and monthly. This aimed to resolve the problem of inefficient usage of multiple applications to keep track of different tasks. 
        
        *2. Instead of making the user type in the minutes, we gave them a drop down menu to easily put in the time. Moreover, we got rid of the exclamation marks and put in a slider for "importance." This was more intuitive for users and it gave great feedback by changing the color of the banner of the modal. Lastly, we added another choice of "other" to include tasks such as laundry.
        
        *3. Once the tasks are put in, the user can easily mark it as done, edit, or delete it.

        *4. Filter allows the user to view just the tasks they want to see. This was to prevent the tasks from being too spread out. It becomes more coherent by allowing the users to see the tasks in a categorized manner.

        *5. Because space was limited for the weekly and monthly views, we added a function of hover to show the necessary details.
