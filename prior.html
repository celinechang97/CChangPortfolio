         How might we help college students prioritize their tasks better so that they become more efficient? 
         <br><br>
         To answer this question, my teammates and I created a web application to help college students organize and prioritize their tasks in daily, weekly, and monthly views. This is different from a normal calendar in that  it is targeted to help people get things done. This platform guides users by breaking down their progress - it shows when they plan on completing the task, how long it will take them to complete it, the importance of the task, and they can also mark it as done when they have accomplished it. As seen below, each card holds all the necessary information mentioned above, with colors representing the importance to help users visualize priority – the darker the shade of red, the higher the priority of the task.

               Students’ biggest pain of their current modes of organization was

               They spent too much time organizing the tasks than actually executing them as it didn't actually help them prioritize all the tasks. Moreover, many people used multiple methods of organization to keep track of all the different tasks in their lives, which was inefficient as they had to navigate back and forth between their applications.

              Before implementing the application on a digital platform, we started with paper prototyping and user-testing with the mock-up to ensure that we hit all of the pains and needs we found through our interviews and observations. We constantly conducted user-testing throughout our process even as we moved onto the digital platform and implemented those valuable feedback in our final design.
               <!-- To address our users’ biggest pain point, we made sure to make this application accessible by making it into a web application that can be easily accessed from computers-- something students always carry around. We also ensured that the process of navigating and utilizing this app was as easy as possible by keeping everything minimal. Lastly, we created three different views (daily, weekly, monthly) to avoid using multiple modes of organization.-->
