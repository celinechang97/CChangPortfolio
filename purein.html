        As part of a global interdisciplinary project, my teammate and I worked with universities in Korea, Mexico, China, and the United States to create a personal mobility device to solve the first-mile last-mile challenge faced by active adults over the age of 60. To support the functionality of this device, we also developed a phone application to help users navigate through the city. Because this application is specifically targeted to the users of the PUMA competition vehicle, the main purpose of the app is to help users navigate easily. Through this vehicle and the app, we wanted to encourage older adults to have a sense of independence, relive their youth, and easily enjoy activities outside by exploring new places.

               Every 2 years, General Motors and PACE partners launch an international design competition to promote collaborative engineering education. 2016 marked the beginning of this Personal Urban Mobility Access (PUMA) Global Collaborative Project to encourage universities to generate solutions to the "first mile-last mile challenge."
               <br><br>
               Older adults utilize public transportation to move about their cities, but traveling from their point of origin to the transit stations and from the stations to their final destination is still an issue -- this is commonly known as the "first-mile-last-mile challenge." The objective of the PUMA competition is to develop a personal mobility device to solve the "first-mile-last-mile challenge" for active older adults -- those above the age of 60. 
               <br><br>
               Northwestern has participated in both years of the design cycle as part of Team 4 which includes: Hongik University in Korea, Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico, Jilin and Wuhan universities in China, and Tuskegee University in the United States. Another group of NU students participated in the first year and we picked up the second half of the cycle to finish for the competition in July 2018.

              The main function of the app is to help navigate around the city and to promote active lifestyles for older adults. Because of our specific target audience, we researched usability guidelines that take the potential limitations of our users into consideration such as memory, vision, or touch. Therefore, when building the prototype, we focused on keeping the flow of the app manageable, such as making it as customizable as possible and taking each action step-by-step and not requiring the users to hold onto much information. Below are some of the wireframes we initially created to test the functionality of the app.
               <div class="prototype_img">
                  <img id="prototype" src="purein_proto1.png" alt="prototype 1">

               </div>

               We first tested out our prototype with college students, who were easy to recruit, to ensure that the mockup had all the necessary functions and that it had a natural user interaction flow. We found that some of the functionalities were missing, such as activating and deactivating the vehicle. Once the prototype had been fleshed out, we tested it with our potential users to ensure that the platform met the users' ability and familiarity. We found that the pace of the step-by-step screen wasn't too fast or too slow, that certain buttons did not look clickable, and that the icon initially used for "settings" was unclear of its functionality.

      <!-- from the initial insights and the findings from user-testing, we implemented the following features: 
            1. A step-by-step on boarding process, with customizable features like font size, to accomodate their possible impaired vision. 

            2. The on-boarding process also allows the users to inform their loved ones about their ride. Because users found that the inclusion of all contacts was too overwhelming, they can revise it to put their "favorited" contacts.

            3. The battery usage screen shows important energy data such as the time remaining and distance left before next charge, updating in real time. 

            Users also have the ability to both quickly activate and deactivate the Pure-In+ from the app.

            4. A step-by-step progress of screens, removing the need for users to memorize much. (use the screen of "cheapest")

            5. Kept navigation the same for all screens (breadcrumb navigation) as reduced memory is a big deterrent for users of this age group. Throughout their journey, users are given a trip timeline that updates as the first mile, public transport, and last mile portions of the journey end. The timeline contains check mark icons to signify when a portion has ended, whether a bus or train is being ridden, and where the Pure-In+ is ridden. This screen appears after every first mile, public transportation, and last mile portion of the journey and requires action from the user to confirm when they’re ready.

            6. During the public transportation session, the app provides detailed information of how many stops there are for the total trip and updates based on the amount of stops left and when the next train will arrive.
            
            All the components are far enough from one another to reduce the frustration of accidentally clicking on another button.

            7. In expanding past the first mile-last mile application, we wanted to provide a way to encourage active seniors to explore their cities a bit more. This first screen shows the weather forecast for the day, followed by recommendation option buttons sorted by four categories: Exercise, Events, Sightseeing, and Shopping. 

            8. Per user testing feedback, the recommendations within these categories are initially sorted by popularity (which is crowdsourced data from the users of the app,) and then by alphabetical order.
