        For a Design Thinking and Doing course, my teammates and I created a portable desk to help students be as productive and efficient as they want to be while not comprising comfort. As the weather gets warmer, many students take advantage of the sun by working outside. However, most, if not all, students find it difficult to find the perfect position as they try to take notes, use laptops, or read textbooks. Therefore, we wanted to help them soak in the vitamin D while they got their work done in a comfortable position by using our portable desk. The surface is big enough to hold their laptop or notebook, but small and light enough to be carried around in their backpacks.

               With so much on students’ plates, it’s important to utilize every bit of time they can get anywhere, anytime. However, those environments are not suitable to get real work done because they lack a hard surface to work on.

               We initially started with the goal of making public transportation rides more efficient for students because those long commutes could be used productively if the environment allowed it.
               <br>
               However, we found that there was a broader problem: 
               
               <div class="io_emphasis"> it is difficult for people to be productive outside – in a non-traditional desk setting.</div> People loved working outside on a sunny day. However, that also came with a desk-less environment. Therefore, they resorted to positions like lying on their stomachs and hunching over, but could not stay in such positions for a long time, preventing them from getting real work done.

               We went out to Northwestern's Lakefill on a sunny day to test our mockup. Not to our surprise, the lawn was full of students — some on their computers and some with their textbook and notebook.
               <br><br>
               We found that, because users were going to be carrying this product, they wanted it to be as compact and light as possible — something that will easily fit inside their bags. If it didn't meet such requirement, they didn't think that they would use it as much.
               <br><br>
               People had different preferences for the height of the desk. Therefore, we utilized a magnetic strip on the side to make it slide and adjust to fit the users’ comfort. We also found that people didn't necessarily want the desk to be over their leg. Some preferred it to be on the outside of their legs. Therefore, we put magnetic strips on both sides so that they could flip the desk and do other activities on top of their legs such as reading a textbook.
