        <div class="how"> How might we help college students live a <div class="emph"> less stressful</div> life? </div><br>

         For my User Experience class, my teammates and I designed a phone application to help college students be on track in a mindful and non-stressful way — to not only focus on the tasks they have to do, but also to be aware of when they are free. Thus, tasks, including free time, are represented by different colors. Along with this value, we encouraged mindfulness by framing tasks as accomplishments — to see a task as part of a process of a long journey. Therefore, we designed the calendar itself to be a universe, a space to be explored, with the tasks (circles) representing planets to be conquered.

               Because students lead such busy lives, it’s easy to get caught up in the midst of everything, making it easy to forget to breathe for a second. Even when they have free time, they constantly double check to make sure that they did everything — not being able to take full advantage of the time to relax.

               Wanting to emphasize free time and a perspective of treating tasks as accomplishments, we initially designed an interface drastically different from other calendars. The circles represented tasks, with colors distinguishing the subject, and were used to emphasize the planets the user would be conquering as they accomplished their tasks. The dotted lines represented the time they had in between the two tasks.

               <div class="prototype_img">

               </div>
       
               However, through user testing, we found that the floating circles and the trails were not intuitive enough for the users. For example, the length of the trail wasn't clear enough to know how much time they had left. 
               <br>
               Therefore, we made a quick pivot.

        1. Because people were confused by our original planet/universe layout, we went with the traditional calendar format. What differentiates this product from others is the usage of color.

        We utilized colors to convey a sense of calmness. This light peach is called cosmic latte, which is an average of all the colors that exist in the universe. Just like the color, we wanted to promote a sense of balance in the users' lives - knowing when to work and knowing when to fully relax.

        Because most people left their free time blank, we filled it up with cosmic latte, specifically allocating that time to relax. We aimed at preventing users from deviating from this free time and stressing out about other tasks.

        
        Moreover, this idea was further portrayed by the usage of gradiation. One event gradually leads to another, conveying a sense of flow. 

        2. Instead of viewing the tasks as simple activities to get out of their way, we wanted them to view the tasks as building blocks for their ultimate goal. We don’t simply ask for the name of the task, but rather ask what they would want to accomplish. This puts them in the perspective of seeing the bigger picture of gaining more knowledge in, for example physics, rather than viewing the task as a tedious lecture.

        3. This is the summary page of the day. We kept the theme of "conquering planets" by keeping the tasks circular and naming the page "Today's Journey." The different colors and sizes convey the different types of tasks - for example, physics class is yellow and an assignment's circle is smaller than an exam's circle.
