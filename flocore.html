         FloCore is an augmented reality application which creates a 3D workspace that molds and flows with the user. Whether it be a research paper, a programming assignment or a video project, FloCore allows the user to customize their work in their physical space to best optimize focus – it aims to disrupt the restrictive model of technology and take the user outside the limitations of the phone screen, tablet or laptop. FloCore is designed to be a malleable system that allows users to be immersed in their work anywhere and anytime. Through a simple set of interactions, they can manipulate their workspace to mimic their thought process. FloCore saves all of their progress in a neat and organized way, allowing them to resume right where they left off without having to re-organize their space. Their work should be efficient, focused and natural as possible, and FloCore is here to help do just that.

               We were tasked with exploring work within the AR space. We were advised to create a technology that could exist ten years into the future, to not worry about technicalities, but to imagine what could be possible — to think magic instead of technology. We decided to explore content generation — how we work when compiling information into one body of work. This system is based off the use case of writing a research paper, as it is a common situation that requires the synthesis of information.

               To study the AR/VR tech, we wanted to ensure that we understood how people used it and how artists imagined it in the movies and videos. Therefore, we first explored movies and works published that were related to AR/VR by creating mood boards to gather and organize ideas. We found that, not only did people use the immediate surrounding as their space, but also used depth as their space — closer objects meaning something different from others that were farther away. We also found a pattern that was common amongst movies that utilized such technology — it all looked very futuristic, mainly utilizing a bright, shiny blue color to differentiate between technology and real objects.

               We then shifted our focus to workspaces and how to utilize VR/AR tech to manage that space. We explored how people organized their workspace by conducting a series of interviews and observational sessions to understand how and why people organized their current workspaces. <br><br>One critical finding was that we identified two main categories of people — Type A and Type B. While Type A had a structured system to organize their work, Type B people had their own way of remembering and organizing things without any solid system. There is, of course, a large portion of individuals who fall in-between these two extremes. With this finding, we did not want to enforce a standard rule of using our system to manage information space and wanted to leave enough room for customization.

              With the exploration of mood boards and workspaces, we decided to narrow down focus to research related tasks. We selected a research topic “World War II” and gave our users this prompt: 
              <br><div class="quote"> "Imagine you are doing a research paper on World War II in a AR space, you can manipulate anything in any way you want." </div>
              We conducted a series of user tests with our tool kit to let them utilize whatever gestures felt most natural to them to organize and manage information in such a scenario.
              We found that there were certain gestures that most people did without being told what to do. We also found that our initial "menu" wasn't as useful, as it got in the way of their workspace. Moreover, there were certain features of the computers that people wanted to keep, which made sense because it was what they had been used to.

The menu consists of a banner surrounding the user, displaying their most recent workspaces. Users can then scroll through or search for workspaces that aren’t currently displayed. It looks a lot like the banner on the bottom of a Mac computer, displaying a list of applications. This felt natural and familiar to people. <br><br> When they open up a previously created workspace, all the content that they had previously opened will be exactly as they left it. This feature was implemented because of people's memory palace – people tend to consistently put certain items in certain places and like to set up in a particular way. Therefore, to help the efficient flow of their work, we wanted to ensure that they didn't have to take the extra step to reorganize their surroundings.

                  <div class="save_content"> From the finding that there are mainly two types of people, A and B (and a lot in-between), we didn't want to force a certain type of organization system because neither type is wrong. Therefore, the system will automatically save the work with a tag specific to the workspace the user is working in — not forcing them to organize, but also providing a system for those who desire organization. For example, if the user is working on a research paper in the “Physics” workspace, the document would have a “Physics” tag. Therefore, even if the user didn’t know which title to search because they forgot what they named the document, they just have to go to the section of “Physics” and quickly skim through.  This system gives the user the flexibility to organize according to their own needs. Moreover, we let our users search between and within workspaces. This was done by creating a “universal” search bar implemented on the menu. They just have to type a keyword of the title in the search bar for the document to pop up. </div>
